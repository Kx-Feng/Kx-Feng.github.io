However, various issues (e.g. privacy leakage and copyright violation)of the training corpus still remain underexplored. For example, the Times suedOpenAI and Microsoft for infringing on its copyrights by using millions of itsarticles for training. From the perspective of LLM practitioners, handling suchunintended privacy violations can be challenging. Previous work addressed the``unlearning" problem of LLMs using gradient information, while they mostlyintroduced significant overheads like data preprocessing or lacked robustness.In this paper, contrasting with the methods based on first-order information,we revisit the unlearning problem via the perspective of second-orderinformation (Hessian). Our unlearning algorithms, which are inspired by classicNewton update, are not only data-agnostic/model-agnostic but also proven to berobust in terms of utility preservation or privacy guarantee. Through acomprehensive evaluation with four NLP datasets as well as a case study onreal-world datasets, our methods consistently show superiority over thefirst-order methods.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-03-09</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16789v3><strong>Detecting Pretraining Data from Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Weijia Shi, Anirudh Ajith, Mengzhou Xia, Yangsibo Huang, Daogao Liu, Terra Blevins, Danqi Chen, Luke Zettlemoyer</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, the data used totrain them is rarely disclosed. Given the incredible scale of this data, up totrillions of tokens, it is all but certain that it includes potentiallyproblematic text such as copyrighted materials, personally identifiableinformation, and test data for widely reported reference benchmarks. However,we currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or inwhat proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detectionproblem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowingthe pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the providedtext? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA thatuses data created before and after model training to support gold truthdetection. We also introduce a new detection method Min-K% Prob based on asimple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier wordswith low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely tohave words with such low probabilities. Min-K% Prob can be applied without anyknowledge about the pretraining corpus or any additional training, departingfrom previous detection methods that require training a reference model on datathat is similar to the pretraining data. Moreover, our experiments demonstratethat Min-K% Prob achieves a 7.4% improvement on WIKIMIA over these previousmethods. We apply Min-K% Prob to three real-world scenarios, copyrighted bookdetection, contaminated downstream example detection and privacy auditing ofmachine unlearning, and find it a consistently effective solution.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-02-29</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16230v5><strong>An Unforgeable Publicly Verifiable Watermark for Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Aiwei Liu, Leyi Pan, Xuming Hu, Shu&rsquo;ang Li, Lijie Wen, Irwin King, Philip S. Yu</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Recently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) havebeen proposed to mitigate the potential harms of text generated by LLMs,including fake news and copyright issues. However, current watermark detectionalgorithms require the secret key used in the watermark generation process,making them susceptible to security breaches and counterfeiting during publicdetection. To address this limitation, we propose an unforgeable publiclyverifiable watermark algorithm that uses two different neural networks forwatermark generation and detection, instead of using the same key at bothstages. Meanwhile, the token embedding parameters are shared between thegeneration and detection networks, which makes the detection network achieve ahigh accuracy very efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithmattains high detection accuracy and computational efficiency through neuralnetworks with a minimized number of parameters. Subsequent analysis confirmsthe high complexity involved in forging the watermark from the detectionnetwork.

With the rise of prompt-basedservices, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers oftendisplay prompts&rsquo; capabilities through input-output examples to attract users.However, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure ofinput-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on theintellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problemstill has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in thispaper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attackframework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA.The main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of theinput-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. Indetail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and promptpruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm basedon differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectivelyinferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and maskthe words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodatediverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify thatPRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios. We have reported thesefindings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to takeprotective measures for prompt copyright.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-02-23</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15060v3><strong>Who Wrote this Code?

For such concerns, several approaches to watermark and detectLLM-generated text have been proposed very recently. However, we discover thatthe previous methods fail to function appropriately with code generation tasksbecause of the syntactic and semantic characteristics of code. Based on\citet{Kirchenbauer2023watermark}, we propose a new watermarking method,Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), that promotes &ldquo;green"tokens only at the position with high entropy of the token distribution duringgeneration, thereby preserving the correctness of the generated code. Thewatermarked code is detected by the statistical test and Z-score based on theentropy information. Our experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that SWEETsignificantly improves the Pareto Frontier between the code correctness andwatermark detection performance. We also show that notable post-hoc detectionmethods (e.g. DetectGPT) fail to work well in this task. Finally, we show thatsetting a reasonable entropy threshold is not much of a challenge.

In this work, we conduct the firstcomprehensive analysis to explore language models&rsquo; (LMs) memorization duringfine-tuning across tasks.

We show at least three scenarios of aligningLLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmfulresponses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3)reducing hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has threeadvantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which aremuch easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting)than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in RLHF(RL from human feedback). (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It isespecially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior.To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLMunlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, andevaluations in LLM unlearning. We show that if practitioners only have limitedresources, and therefore the priority is to stop generating undesirable outputsrather than to try to generate desirable outputs, unlearning is particularlyappealing. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows thatunlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just2% of its computational time.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-02-15</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08787v2><strong>Rethinking Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Sijia Liu, Yuanshun Yao, Jinghan Jia, Stephen Casper, Nathalie Baracaldo, Peter Hase, Xiaojun Xu, Yuguang Yao, Hang Li, Kush R.

Document-level inference hasbeen proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trainedmodel whether a piece of content has been seen during training. SOTA methodshowever rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content.While very effective against models that memorize a lot, we hypothesize&ndash;andlater confirm&ndash;that they will not work against models that do not naturallymemorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models. We here propose to use copyright traps,the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use ofcopyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization doesnot naturally occur. We carefully design an experimental setup, randomlyinserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM. We firstvalidate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectableusing existing methods. We then show, contrary to intuition, that evenmedium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) arenot detectable using existing methods. However, we show that longer sequencesrepeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and usedas copyright traps. We further improve these results by studying how the numberof times a sequence is seen improves detectability, how sequences with higherperplexity tend to be memorized more, and how taking context into accountfurther improves detectability.</div></details><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09299v1><strong>Trained Without My Consent: Detecting Code Inclusion In Language Models Trained on Code</strong></a></p><p><em>Vahid Majdinasab, Amin Nikanjam, Foutse Khomh</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards,regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not containcode from protected sources. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challengesfor code auditing. The dataset for training these models is mainly collectedfrom publicly available sources. This raises the issue of intellectual propertyinfringement as developers&rsquo; codes are already included in the dataset.Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it isdifficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trainedon specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the trainingdatasets of these models. Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets,traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient forasserting copyright infringement. To address this challenge, we propose a newapproach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membershipinference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM&rsquo;s training dataset. We extractsyntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifierfor detecting code inclusion. In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC iscapable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM. Incomparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable ofdetecting 47.64%. In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has lowresource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conductedduring the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker,across thousands of code snippets.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-02-10</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06233v5><strong>Data Contamination Quiz: A Tool to Detect and Estimate Contamination in Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Shahriar Golchin, Mihai Surdeanu</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: We propose the Data Contamination Quiz (DCQ), a simple and effective approachto detect data contamination in large language models (LLMs) and estimate theamount of it.

These changes only includeword-level perturbations. The generated perturbed versions, along with theoriginal instance, form the options in the DCQ, with an extra optionaccommodating the possibility that none of the provided choices is correct.Given that the only distinguishing signal among the choices is the exactwording relative to the original instance, an LLM, when tasked with identifyingthe original instance from the choices, gravitates towards the original one ifit has been exposed to it in its pre-training phase&ndash;a trait intrinsic to LLMs.Tested over several datasets with GPT-4/3.5, our findings&ndash;while fully lackingaccess to LLMs&rsquo; pre-training data and internal parameters&ndash;suggest that DCQuncovers greater contamination levels compared to existing detection methodsand proficiently bypasses more safety filters, especially those set to avoidgenerating copyrighted contents.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-02-07</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04828v2><strong>Human-Readable Fingerprint for Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Boyi Zeng, Chenghu Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Zhouhan Lin</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucialdue to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designedlicenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challengingdue to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce ahuman-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base modelwithout exposing model parameters or interfering with training. We firstobserve that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after themodel has converged during pretraining, showing negligible perturbationsthrough subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervisedfine-tuning (SFT), and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identifythe base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM withan extra term to drive away the model parameters&rsquo; direction and the modelbecomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks likedimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it withoutaffecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure,we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant termsthat identify an LLM&rsquo;s base model. We make these invariant terms human-readableby mapping them to a Gaussian vector using a convolutional encoder and thenconverting it into a natural image with StyleGAN2. Our method generates a dogimage as an identity fingerprint for an LLM, where the dog&rsquo;s appearancestrongly indicates the LLM&rsquo;s base model. The fingerprint provides intuitiveinformation for qualitative discrimination, while the invariant terms can beemployed for quantitative and precise verification. Experimental results acrossvarious LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-01-23</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07913v4><strong>A Survey of Text Watermarking in the Era of Large Language Models</strong></a></p><p><em>Aiwei Liu, Leyi Pan, Yijian Lu, Jingjing Li, Xuming Hu, Xi Zhang, Lijie Wen, Irwin King, Hui Xiong, Philip S.

However, the vast potential and remarkablecapabilities of LLMs also raise new security and privacy concerns if they areexploited for nefarious purposes due to their open-endedness. For example, LLMsmay be used to plagiarize or imitate writing, thereby infringing the copyrightof the original content, or to create indiscriminate fake information based ona certain source text. In some cases, LLMs can even analyze text from theInternet to infer personal privacy. Unfortunately, previous text protectionresearch could not foresee the emergence of powerful LLMs, rendering it nolonger effective in this new context. To bridge this gap, we introduce SilentGuardian (SG), a text protection mechanism against LLMs, which allows LLMs torefuse to generate response when receiving protected text, preventing themalicious use of text from the source. Specifically, we first propose theconcept of Truncation Protection Examples (TPE). By carefully modifying thetext to be protected, TPE can induce LLMs to first sample the end token, thusdirectly terminating the interaction. In addition, to efficiently construct TPEin the discrete space of text data, we propose a novel optimization algorithmcalled Super Taliored Protection (STP), which is not only highly efficient butalso maintains the semantic consistency of the text during the optimizationprocess. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SG caneffectively protect the target text under various configurations and achievealmost 100% protection success rate in some cases. Notably, SG also exhibitsrelatively good transferability and robustness, making its application inpractical scenarios possible.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-01-07</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04136v1><strong>The Stronger the Diffusion Model, the Easier the Backdoor: Data Poisoning to Induce Copyright Breaches Without Adjusting Finetuning Pipeline</strong></a></p><p><em>Haonan Wang, Qianli Shen, Yao Tong, Yang Zhang, Kenji Kawaguchi</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: The commercialization of diffusion models, renowned for their ability togenerate high-quality images that are often indistinguishable from real ones,brings forth potential copyright concerns.

This data,comprising poisoning images equipped with prompts, is generated by leveragingthe powerful capabilities of multimodal large language models and text-guidedimage inpainting techniques. Our experimental results and analysis confirm themethod&rsquo;s effectiveness. By integrating a minor portion ofnon-copyright-infringing stealthy poisoning data into the cleandataset-rendering it free from suspicion-we can prompt the finetuned diffusionmodels to produce copyrighted content when activated by specific triggerprompts. These findings underline potential pitfalls in the prevailingcopyright protection strategies and underscore the necessity for increasedscrutiny and preventative measures against the misuse of DMs.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2024-01-02</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00860v2><strong>Towards Code Watermarking with Dual-Channel Transformations</strong></a></p><p><em>Borui Yang, Wei Li, Liyao Xiang, Bo Li</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: The expansion of the open source community and the rise of large languagemodels have raised ethical and security concerns on the distribution of sourcecode, such as misconduct on copyrighted code, distributions without properlicenses, or misuse of the code for malicious purposes. Hence it is importantto track the ownership of source code, in which watermarking is a majortechnique. Yet, drastically different from natural languages, source codewatermarking requires far stricter and more complicated rules to ensure thereadability as well as the functionality of the source code. Hence we introduceSrcMarker, a watermarking system to unobtrusively encode ID bitstrings intosource code, without affecting the usage and semantics of the code. To thisend, SrcMarker performs transformations on an AST-based intermediaterepresentation that enables unified transformations across differentprogramming languages. The core of the system utilizes learning-based embeddingand extraction modules to select rule-based transformations for watermarking.In addition, a novel feature-approximation technique is designed to tackle theinherent non-differentiability of rule selection, thus seamlessly integratingthe rule-based transformations and learning-based networks into aninterconnected system to enable end-to-end training.

Companies have emerged to provide multi-modal Embedding as aService (EaaS) based on VLPs (e.g., CLIP-based VLPs), which cost a large amountof training data and resources for high-performance service. However, existingstudies indicate that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks thatinduce great loss for the owners of VLPs. Protecting the intellectual propertyand commercial ownership of VLPs is increasingly crucial yet challenging. Amajor solution of watermarking model for EaaS implants a backdoor in the modelby inserting verifiable trigger embeddings into texts, but it is onlyapplicable for large language models and is unrealistic due to data and modelprivacy. In this paper, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based embeddingwatermarking method for VLPs called VLPMarker. VLPMarker utilizes embeddingorthogonal transformation to effectively inject triggers into the VLPs withoutinterfering with the model parameters, which achieves high-quality copyrightverification and minimal impact on model performance. To enhance the watermarkrobustness, we further propose a collaborative copyright verification strategybased on both backdoor trigger and embedding distribution, enhancing resilienceagainst various attacks. We increase the watermark practicality via anout-of-distribution trigger selection approach, removing access to the modeltraining data and thus making it possible for many real-world scenarios.

Unlike most earlier machine learning models,they are no longer built for one specific application but are designed to excelin a wide range of tasks. A major part of this success is due to their hugetraining datasets and the unprecedented number of model parameters, which allowthem to memorize large amounts of information contained in the training data.This memorization goes beyond mere language, and encompasses information onlypresent in a few documents. This is often desirable since it is necessary forperforming tasks such as question answering, and therefore an important part oflearning, but also brings a whole array of issues, from privacy and security tocopyright and beyond. LLMs can memorize short secrets in the training data, butcan also memorize concepts like facts or writing styles that can be expressedin text in many different ways. We propose a taxonomy for memorization in LLMsthat covers verbatim text, facts, ideas and algorithms, writing styles,distributional properties, and alignment goals. We describe the implications ofeach type of memorization - both positive and negative - for model performance,privacy, security and confidentiality, copyright, and auditing, and ways todetect and prevent memorization. We further highlight the challenges that arisefrom the predominant way of defining memorization with respect to modelbehavior instead of model weights, due to LLM-specific phenomena such asreasoning capabilities or differences between decoding algorithms.

We evaluate our technique on the task of unlearning the Harry Potter booksfrom the Llama2-7b model (a generative language model recently open-sourced byMeta). While the model took over 184K GPU-hours to pretrain, we show that inabout 1 GPU hour of finetuning, we effectively erase the model&rsquo;s ability togenerate or recall Harry Potter-related content, while its performance oncommon benchmarks (such as Winogrande, Hellaswag, arc, boolq and piqa) remainsalmost unaffected. We make our fine-tuned model publicly available onHuggingFace for community evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst paper to present an effective technique for unlearning in generativelanguage models. Our technique consists of three main components: First, we use a reinforcedmodel that is further trained on the target data to identify the tokens thatare most related to the unlearning target, by comparing its logits with thoseof a baseline model. Second, we replace idiosyncratic expressions in the targetdata with generic counterparts, and leverage the model&rsquo;s own predictions togenerate alternative labels for every token. These labels aim to approximatethe next-token predictions of a model that has not been trained on the targetdata.

We can foresee that exceptional AI tools will soon reapconsiderable profits. A crucial question arise: should AI tools share revenuewith their training data providers in additional to traditional stakeholdersand shareholders? The answer is Yes. Large AI tools, such as large languagemodels, always require more and better quality data to continuously improve,but current copyright laws limit their access to various types of data. Sharingrevenue between AI tools and their data providers could transform the currenthostile zero-sum game relationship between AI tools and a majority ofcopyrighted data owners into a collaborative and mutually beneficial one, whichis necessary to facilitate the development of a virtuous cycle among AI tools,their users and data providers that drives forward AI technology and builds ahealthy AI ecosystem. However, current revenue-sharing business models do notwork for AI tools in the forthcoming AI era, since the most widely used metricsfor website-based traffic and action, such as clicks, will be replaced by newmetrics such as prompts and cost per prompt for generative AI tools. Acompletely new revenue-sharing business model, which must be almost independentof AI tools and be easily explained to data providers, needs to establish aprompt-based scoring system to measure data engagement of each data provider.This paper systematically discusses how to build such a scoring system for alldata providers for AI tools based on classification and content similaritymodels, and outlines the requirements for AI tools or third parties to buildit. Sharing revenue with data providers using such a scoring system wouldencourage more data owners to participate in the revenue-sharing program.

Our extensive experiments onvarious datasets show that our method can effectively protect the copyright ofEaaS models without compromising service quality.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2023-05-31</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09864v2><strong>Synthetic Pre-Training Tasks for Neural Machine Translation</strong></a></p><p><em>Zexue He, Graeme Blackwood, Rameswar Panda, Julian McAuley, Rogerio Feris</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Pre-training models with large crawled corpora can lead to issues such astoxicity and bias, as well as copyright and privacy concerns. A promising wayof alleviating such concerns is to conduct pre-training with synthetic tasksand data, since no real-world information is ingested by the model. Our goal inthis paper is to understand the factors that contribute to the effectiveness ofpre-training models when using synthetic resources, particularly in the contextof neural machine translation. We propose several novel approaches topre-training translation models that involve different levels of lexical andstructural knowledge, including: 1) generating obfuscated data from a largeparallel corpus 2) concatenating phrase pairs extracted from a smallword-aligned corpus, and 3) generating synthetic parallel data without realhuman language corpora. Our experiments on multiple language pairs reveal thatpre-training benefits can be realized even with high levels of obfuscation orpurely synthetic parallel data. We hope the findings from our comprehensiveempirical analysis will shed light on understanding what matters for NMTpre-training, as well as pave the way for the development of more efficient andless toxic models.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2023-05-08</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04701v1><strong>Differentially Private Attention Computation</strong></a></p><p><em>Yeqi Gao, Zhao Song, Xin Yang</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have had a profound impact on numerous aspectsof daily life including natural language processing, content generation,research methodologies and so on. However, one crucial issue concerning theinference results of large language models is security and privacy. In manyscenarios, the results generated by LLMs could possibly leak many confidentialor copyright information. A recent beautiful and breakthrough work [Vyas,Kakade and Barak 2023] focus on such privacy issue of the LLMs from theoreticalperspective. It is well-known that computing the attention matrix is one of themajor task during the LLMs computation. Thus, how to give a provable privatelyguarantees of computing the attention matrix is an important researchdirection. Previous work [Alman and Song 2023, Brand, Song and Zhou 2023] have proposedprovable tight result for fast computation of attention without consideringprivacy concerns. One natural mathematical formulation to quantity the privacyin theoretical computer science graduate school textbook is differentialprivacy. Inspired by [Vyas, Kakade and Barak 2023], in this work, we provide aprovable result for showing how to differentially private approximate theattention matrix. From technique perspective, our result replies on a pioneering work in thearea of differential privacy by [Alabi, Kothari, Tankala, Venkat and Zhang2022].</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2023-04-06</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02839v1><strong>Whose Text Is It Anyway?

Emerging ethical approaches haveattempted to filter pretraining material, but such approaches have been ad hocand failed to take context into account. We offer an approach to filteringgrounded in law, which has directly addressed the tradeoffs in filteringmaterial. First, we gather and make available the Pile of Law, a 256GB (andgrowing) dataset of open-source English-language legal and administrative data,covering court opinions, contracts, administrative rules, and legislativerecords. Pretraining on the Pile of Law may help with legal tasks that have thepromise to improve access to justice. Second, we distill the legal norms thatgovernments have developed to constrain the inclusion of toxic or privatecontent into actionable lessons for researchers and discuss how our datasetreflects these norms. Third, we show how the Pile of Law offers researchers theopportunity to learn such filtering rules directly from the data, providing anexciting new research direction in model-based processing.</div></details><blockquote><p><strong><em>2022-08-03</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02080v1><strong>A Feature-space Multimodal Data Augmentation Technique for Text-video Retrieval</strong></a></p><p><em>Alex Falcon, Giuseppe Serra, Oswald Lanz</em></p><details><summary>abstract</summary><div class=markdown-inner>abstract: Every hour, huge amounts of visual contents are posted on social media anduser-generated content platforms. To find relevant videos by means of a naturallanguage query, text-video retrieval methods have received increased attentionover the past few years. Data augmentation techniques were introduced toincrease the performance on unseen test examples by creating new trainingsamples with the application of semantics-preserving techniques, such as colorspace or geometric transformations on images. Yet, these techniques are usuallyapplied on raw data, leading to more resource-demanding solutions and alsorequiring the shareability of the raw data, which may not always be true, e.g.copyright issues with clips from movies or TV series. To address thisshortcoming, we propose a multimodal data augmentation technique which works inthe feature space and creates new videos and captions by mixing semanticallysimilar samples. We experiment our solution on a large scale public dataset,EPIC-Kitchens-100, and achieve considerable improvements over a baselinemethod, improved state-of-the-art performance, while at the same timeperforming multiple ablation studies.

This paper aims to help address documentation debt for BookCorpus, apopular text dataset for training large language models. Notably, researchershave used BookCorpus to train OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-N models and Google&rsquo;s BERT models,even though little to no documentation exists about the dataset&rsquo;s motivation,composition, collection process, etc. We offer a preliminary datasheet thatprovides key context and information about BookCorpus, highlighting severalnotable deficiencies. In particular, we find evidence that (1) BookCorpuslikely violates copyright restrictions for many books, (2) BookCorpus containsthousands of duplicated books, and (3) BookCorpus exhibits significant skews ingenre representation. We also find hints of other potential deficiencies thatcall for future research, including problematic content, potential skews inreligious representation, and lopsided author contributions. While more workremains, this initial effort to provide a datasheet for BookCorpus adds togrowing literature that urges more careful and systematic documentation formachine learning datasets.</div></details></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
